# Package Description

## Getting Started

This Robot Framework tutorial contains robot code examples together with
the documentation explaining how to use these examples and how they
work. The basic idea behind this tutorial is not to have theory only but
additionally to this theory also the possibility to experience what is
explained inside.

The main focus of this tutorial is on some feature extensions available
for the Robot Framework.

An overviev about those extensions of the Robot Framework can be found
here:

[test-fullautomation](https://github.com/test-fullautomation)

It is assumed that the user is already familiar with basic Robot
Framework functionality.

Here you find the online version of the rendered [tutorial
documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-tutorial/blob/develop/robot_framework_tutorial.html).
