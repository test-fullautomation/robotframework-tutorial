Package Description
===================

Getting Started
---------------

The RobotFramework AIO tutorial contains robot code examples together with the documentation explaining how to use these
examples and how they work. The basic idea behind this tutorial is not to have theory only but additionally to this theory
also the possibility to experience what is explained inside.

The main focus of this tutorial is on all additional features provided by the RobotFramework AIO. It is assumed
that the user is already familiar with basic RobotFramework functionality.

An overviev about helpful extensions of the RobotFramework can be found here:

`test-fullautomation <https://github.com/test-fullautomation>`_

How to install
--------------

Clone the **robotframework-tutorial** repository to your machine.

`robotframework-tutorial <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-tutorial>`_

After this you can directly navigate to the subfolders of your local repository folder.
Every subfolder contains a separate chapter of the tutorial that can be investigated individually.
