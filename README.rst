Package Description
===================

Getting Started
---------------

This Robot Framework tutorial contains robot code examples together with the documentation explaining how to use these
examples and how they work. The basic idea behind this tutorial is not to have theory only but additionally to this theory
also the possibility to experience what is explained inside.

The main focus of this tutorial is on some feature extensions available for the Robot Framework.

An overviev about those extensions of the Robot Framework can be found here:

`test-fullautomation <https://github.com/test-fullautomation>`_

It is assumed that the user is already familiar with basic Robot Framework functionality.

Here you find the online version of the rendered `tutorial documentation <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-tutorial/blob/develop/robot_framework_tutorial.html>`_.

`Tutorial main sections <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-tutorial/blob/HolQue/task/documentation_maintenance/robot_framework_tutorial.html>`_
